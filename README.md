## Project Description :-
Welcome to Labmate🔬, a simple inventory management system built entirely using language C. I have visited laboratories a lot of time and have noticed that the face problem of chemical (required to perform tests) which results in delaying of test reports and also they used to store all the details of the patients on a normal note book making it difficult to find patients details. So I have decided to create a minimal command line based inventory management system which is capable of doing all necessary tasks (mentioned in features) .




## Goals Associated:-
My main aims behind implementing this project are:

- Try implementing a projet in c for better understanding of the language.
- Getting comfortable with making projects in the language by trying resolve the issue faced during creation of project.
- Try to figure out a solution to a practicle problem statement using programming.
## Features

- Add custom medical test. 
- Check chemical stock left in inventory.
- Low appratus Warning. ⚠ 
- End of day tests report.

## Learning Objectives 
This project will help me to increase overall grip over the C language
Specially in topics like :-

- Structues
- File handling 
- Pointers etc

Which i guess are a bit tricky to learn and understand. 

Also to take my learing even further i made my whole project in Linux operating system 
using vim editor which helped me a lot about linux and an editor like vim. 

  
## 🛠 Skills Required
   Programming with C , Data structures and algorithms in C , File handling in C...

  
## Real life Application 

This project can be used in:
- Private laboratories 🔬 
- Hospital 🏥
